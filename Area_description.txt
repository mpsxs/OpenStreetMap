The area includes not only Seattle, but a good portion of Western Washington. Olympia, Everett, Bellingham, and other major Washington cities are included in the dataset. A portion of Vancouver island, a part of Canada, is also present. Aside from cities, the region also includes a large amount of forested and mountainous area.

I chose this region because I was born and raised here.
